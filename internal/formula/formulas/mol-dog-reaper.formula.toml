Reap stale wisps and close stale issues across all Dolt databases.

The Reaper Dog closes wisps past their retention age, purges closed wisps
older than the purge threshold, and auto-closes stale issues. This keeps
the wisp and issue tables from growing unbounded.

The Go daemon (wisp_reaper.go) runs this as a thin orchestrator that pours
this molecule and delegates to step functions matching these formula steps.
SQL operations remain in Go (batch DELETEs, multi-table cascades, DOLT_COMMIT
wrapping require imperative control flow).

## Dog Contract

This is infrastructure work:
1. Scan all production databases for stale wisps
2. Reap (close) wisps past max_age
3. Purge (delete) closed wisps past purge_age + old mail
4. Auto-close stale issues (>30 days, not P0/P1, not epics, no active deps)
5. Report findings and return to kennel

## Variables

| Variable | Source | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| max_age | config | Max wisp age before reaping (default 24h) |
| purge_age | config | Max closed wisp age before purging (default 7d) |
| stale_issue_age | config | Max issue staleness before auto-close (default 30d) |

## Safety

Reaping closes wisps — reversible (can reopen). Purging deletes rows — irreversible
but only targets already-closed wisps past retention. Auto-close only targets
issues that are not P0/P1, not epics, and have no active dependencies."""

Discover databases and count stale wisps.

**1. Determine databases to scan:**
Use configured databases list, or auto-discover from Dolt server.

**2. For each database, count wisps by status and age:**
```sql
-- Open wisps past max_age (reap candidates)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wisps
WHERE status IN ('open', 'hooked', 'in_progress')
AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL {{max_age}};

-- Closed wisps past purge_age (purge candidates)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wisps
WHERE status = 'closed'
AND closed_at < NOW() - INTERVAL {{purge_age}};

-- Total open wisps (for alert threshold)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wisps
WHERE status IN ('open', 'hooked', 'in_progress');

**3. Record scan results:**
- Databases scanned
- Reap candidates per database
- Purge candidates per database
- Total open wisp count
